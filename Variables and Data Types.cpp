int age;  // Declares an integer variable named age
double pi = 3.14159;  // Declares a double variable named pi and initializes it with a value
char initial = 'S';  // Declares a char variable named initial and initializes it
bool isSunny = true;  // Declares a bool variable named isSunny and initializes it


//here all the int, double, char, bool (boolen) are the variables.

int sum = age + 10;  // Expression calculates sum using variables and operators


//in this above it will calculate the age +10 as commanded above when user input the age it will addup 10 into the age and print the value.
